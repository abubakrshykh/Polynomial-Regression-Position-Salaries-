# Polynomial-Regression-Position-Salaries-
This repository contains code for a Polynomial Regression model trained to predict the salary based on position levels. 

# Polynomial Regression Model
This repository contains the code for a Polynomial Regression model developed to predict the salary based on position levels. The model is trained using the Position_Salaries.csv dataset. The model uses the degree 4 polynomial function to fit the data.

# Prerequisites
The following packages need to be installed before running the code:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the following file:

Position_Salaries.csv


# Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy score of accuracy score and an R2 score of R2 score on the test dataset.

# Visualization
The following visualizations are produced by the model:

Scatter plot of training data with linear regression line (Position Level vs Salary)
Scatter plot of training data with polynomial regression line (Position Level vs Salary)
Scatter plot of test data with polynomial regression line (Position Level vs Salary)
Manual Prediction
The model can also predict the salary for a given position level using the "predict" method. An example is provided in the code.
